The benefit is that SSL links (https) to inappropriate sites will always be blocked, even if the SSL feature is not activated for the protected device. The current disadvantage of this new feature is that blocked pages will just be displayed as standard browser error. Further details about why the page has been blocked are not yet available in this mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDatabase Backup\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn rare cases, it could occur that the eBlocker’s database got corrupted, e.g. if the power had been removed, while a database write process was in progress.
