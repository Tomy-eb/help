Sometimes you may also encounter the abbreviation TLS (TLS stands for Transport Layer Security). It is basically the same as SSL. If the standard Web protocol HTTP is encrypted using SSL, it is called HTTPS. You can recognize an encrypted loaded page by the URL starting with https:// Many browsers also display a green lock in the address bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany websites, especially those of banks and online shops, are now protected with SSL encryption. This way you can be sure that you are actually communicating with the provider who's URL you have accessed and that no third party can change or read your entered data. However, not only reputable shops and banks use SSL. Tracking and advertising providers are also increasingly collecting their data via HTTPS/SSL. Your profile data is then sent to the tracking server in encrypted form, but of course this does not prevent the data collector from continuing to create a detailed profile of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce HTTPS support is enabled in eBlocker, each eBlocker generates a unique device root certificate and a private key. This certificate is used to encrypt communication between your device and the eBlocker when the eBlocker loads an SSL-protected web page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce HTTPS is activated, the eBlocker terminates the encrypted connection so that the data stream can be analyzed. The eBlocker is the end of \"end-to-end encryption\". Since the browser expects an encrypted connection with HTTPS, the eBlocker then encrypts the communication to your end device. To do this, it is necessary to first include the so-called security certificate of your eBlocker in your operating system and then, if necessary, in the browsers with its own certificate store as described in Section 6.2. This certificate is sometimes also called a certificate for certification authorities, a root certificate, or a root certificate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have no access to your private key or your device and have done everything to protect the eBlocker from hackers - but of course there is no 100 percent security.

Most hardware firewalls provide a DHCP server in the network settings. If the eBlocker is not compatible with the hardware firewall in automatic network mode (Plug \u0026amp; Play), then you can put the eBlocker in its individual network settings. After setting, the eBlocker will take over the DHCP server. We recommend deactivating the DHCP server in the network settings of the hardware firewall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t need a DHCP server in your network, you can put the eBlocker in his individual network settings and disable the DHCP server of the eBlocker. You will see the IP address of the hardware firewall as the gateway in the network settings of the eBlocker. For the network settings of the devices, we recommend inserting the IP address of the eBlocker as the gateway. If a device is not protected by the eBlocker, you must enter the IP address of the hardware firewall as the gateway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"},{"id":360002340254,"url":"https://eblocker.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360002340254-Check-the-network-connection-with-macOS-.json","html_url":"https://support.eblocker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002340254-Check-the-network-connection-with-macOS-","author_id":116161470334,"comments_disabled":true,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":7,"vote_sum":4,"vote_count":4,"section_id":360000522734,"created_at":"2018-03-24T15:29:10Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T19:19:59Z","name":"Check the network connection with macOS.","title":"Check the network connection with macOS.","source_locale":"en-us","locale":"en-us","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2018-03-24T15:29:10Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":744634,"label_names":["connection","verbindung","netzwerk","network","mac","macos","mac os"],"body":"\u003cdiv class=\"rollbar-content\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; height: auto; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"modalBlock bottom-nav\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you do not know your eBlocker's IP address, please check the network settings of your router.
