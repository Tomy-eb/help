Malicious software can get into your computer by visiting infected websites or by opening infected emails. Even banner ads that appear on websites which appear as trustworthy may contain the so called âmalwareâ in short. Not every malware is immediately noticed (or at all). The best way to protect yourself from malware is to keep your system as up to date as possible; no opening of suspicious emails that are send from dubious sources; using the latest antivirus program and of course, using your eBlocker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork mask\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith help of the IP address the network mask defines which other IP addresses belong to the local net. That means which addresses can be reached directly. All other IP addresses that do not belong to one network mask, do not belong to the local network and can only be reached through the router.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrice discrimination\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrice discrimination describes a price policy on the Internet, where you get different prices for the same product depending on from which device you want to buy the product. The price is set dynamically according to the known data of the user with the aim to maximize their revenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReferrer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you open a website, your browser sends you an according request for the website you want to visit. This request not only contains the URL, but also many other meta-files for requests. Amongst other things the browser transmits from which website the new request was send from.

In connection with the certificates, it ensures, that no changes can be made to the data on the way from the server to a browser and the data exchange can not be read by unauthorized persons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf an Internet user logs into a forum or an online shop, his registration data and texts can easily be viewed and later misused when sent without SSL encryption. If the connection is protected by SSL, it would take a relatively high effort to decrypt this encryption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTor Network\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tor network is used to disguise your original IP address and to provide anonymous Internet surfing. Suppose you have a certain page you want to visit and therefore you enter the URL into the web browser. Your IP address is sent directly to the page you want to visit. However, if you use Tor, you will be directed into the Tor network, which is made out of many other IP addresses from different computers. The Tor network will send an IP address to the page that it chooses randomly out of all the other IP addresses floating around the Tor network. This is how your real IP address is disguised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTracker â Data collector\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the time trackers are service providers for advertising industries.
